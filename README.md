The Kick.com Username Checker is a powerful tool that allows me to check the availability of usernames on Kick.com. I have built it with Go and utilized the Kick API to quickly and efficiently verify the status of usernames. :mag_right:

## Features :sparkles:

- :white_check_mark: **Username Availability Check:** The program reads a list of usernames from a file and checks their availability on Kick.com.
- :zap: **Concurrency:** I can specify the number of threads to use for concurrent checking, making the process faster.
- :open_file_folder: **Output File:** Valid usernames are saved to an output file for further analysis and use.

## How to Use :computer:

1. Prepare a file named `usernames.txt` with a list of usernames, each on a new line.
2. Run the program and follow the prompts to specify the number of threads to use.
3. The program will start checking the availability of the usernames and save the valid ones to an output file.
4. Once the program finishes, I can find the valid usernames in the `output.txt` file.

## Roadmap :bulb:

I have an exciting roadmap for the Kick.com Username Checker based on the number of stars this repository receives:

- :star2: **5 Stars:** Add Username Generator: Generate random usernames and check their availability.
- :star2::star2: **10 Stars:** Add Proxies: Integrate proxy support for anonymous and distributed checking.
- :star2::star2::star2: **25 Stars:** Add Username Claimer: Automate the process of claiming available usernames on Kick.com.

Your support and contribution will help me reach these goals faster! :rocket:
